<p>I’m a CPA but I’ve fallen in love with Data Science. 
    
<p>Looking back at my work experience, the times that really lit up my soul at work were the times when I was working with technology to go over large amounts of data. Whether it was extracting data, exploring and understanding client data, or gleaning insights from data to find solutions, I always enjoyed this part of my past roles. 
    
<p>And so when I immigrated to Canada in 2020, I thought, in this new land with new friends and new experiences, why not also pursue a new career? And so I did. After a few online courses and a certificate from Ryerson University, I am now ready to jump into this field as a data scientist/data analyst.
    
<p>My portfolio of projects shows my technical abilities. These demonstrate my knowledge of the different types of machine learning models, deep learning, data visualization, and the data science workflow. 
    
<p>Python is my weapon of choice along with SQL and Tableau. I also have experience in R, TensorFlow, Keras, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas among others. 
    
<p>I am continuing my study of other data science concepts and applications such as computer vision. I am interested in exploring ways with which I can integrate data science in my art. Oh, I am also an artist! I mainly work with oil paint and am known to collectors for my series of paintings of crumpled papers. <a href="https://www.iancasti.com/">Checkout iancasti.com!</a>
