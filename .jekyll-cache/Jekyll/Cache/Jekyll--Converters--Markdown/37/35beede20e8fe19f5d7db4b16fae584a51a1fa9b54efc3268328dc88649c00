<p>Be Kind Rewind is a YouTube mainly about past best actress winners, women in film, and film and Hollywood history. The videos delve into the career of these accomplished women and the circumstances that lead to their win. The videos are well-researched and very insightful. I love history, I love film, and I love women in film so I truly enjoy every video from this channel. And so I wanted to see what other people thought about this channel and its videos.</p>

<p>In this project, I apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine the general sentiments on this channel. The results of this project will provide the creator behind this YouTube channel a good idea of how viewers perceive the content produced.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>The goals of this project are:
 -Use the YouTube API to collect the data for this project
 -Analyze the performance of the videos of the channel
 -Determine the polarity of sentiments in the video comments using NLP
 -Get the most common words used in comments
 -Determine the overall sentiment for the channel</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>•	Python - used to extract the data, clean and preprocess the data, get the sentiments from the comments, and analyze the data. The libraries used were:
    -NumPy<br />
    -Pandas<br />
    -Google API client<br />
    -Matplotlib<br />
    -Seaborn<br />
    -WordCloud<br />
    -Demoji<br />
    -NLTK<br />
    -TextBlob<br />
•	SQL Server – store the data and retrieve information for analysis
•	YouTube API – source of the data</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data">Kaggle.com</a>. The used cars dataset was first scraped in 2018 from Craigslist. It is updated every few months with the latest data. The dataset was split into pre-pandemic and pandemic datasets. There are 23 variables in the dataset before any preprocessing and cleaning. It has 1,961,218 samples with 1,076,152 pre-pandemic data and 885,066 data during the pandemic.</p>

<h2 id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Steps taken to clean the data included remove unnecessary columns, remove samples wiht missing values, and remove outliers among others. The final dataset after preprocessing and cleaning contained 194,861 rows. All the variables were categorical except for price and mileage (odometer) which were converted to price range and mileage range, respectively. The 14 independent variables were one-hot encoded into 884 independent variables.</p>

<h2 id="eda">EDA</h2>
<p>The exploratory data analysis was done with target questions in mind. Some of the insights learned are shown below.</p>

<h4 id="correlation">Correlation</h4>
<p>There is a direct correlation between price and year. The more higher (more recent) the year, the higher the price of the used car since it is relatively newer. On the other hand, there is an indirect correlation between price and odometer. The higher the odometer reading, the lower the price of the car. This because the odometer reading reflects how much the car has been used. This translates to the amount of wear and tear the car has endured. The more the car has been used, the lower the price.</p>
