I"<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiolZNLiJplmCCzqk9-czQ">Be Kind Rewind</a> is a YouTube mainly about past best actress winners, women in film, and film and Hollywood history. The videos delve into the career of these accomplished women and the circumstances that lead to their win. The videos are well-researched and very insightful. I love history, I love film, and I love women in film so I truly enjoy every video from this channel. And so I wanted to see what other people thought about this channel and its videos.</p>

<p>In this project, I apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine the general sentiments on this channel. The results of this project will provide the creator behind this YouTube channel a good idea of how viewers perceive the content produced.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>The goals of this project are:
 -Use the YouTube API to collect the data for this project
 -Analyze the performance of the videos of the channel
 -Determine the polarity of sentiments in the video comments using NLP
 -Get the most common words used in comments
 -Determine the overall sentiment for the channel</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python - used to extract the data, clean and preprocess the data, get the sentiments from the comments, and analyze the data. The libraries used were:
    <ul>
      <li>NumPy</li>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>Google API client</li>
      <li>Matplotlib</li>
      <li>Seaborn</li>
      <li>WordCloud</li>
      <li>Demoji</li>
      <li>NLTK</li>
      <li>TextBlob</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SQL Server – store the data and retrieve information for analysis</li>
  <li>YouTube API – source of the data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download channel, video, and comments data from YouTube using the YouTube API</li>
  <li>Clean and preprocess the data</li>
  <li>Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data</li>
  <li>Analyze the sentiment of all the comments on the videos and the channel as a whole</li>
  <li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>The data was scraped using Google Youtube Data API version 3.0. There are two datasets: one for the details for each of the 67 videos on the channel and one for the comments posted for all of the videos on the channel. The first dataset was used to analyze the overall performance of the channel. The second dataset was used to get the sentiments from viewers.</p>

<h2 id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>After importing the libraries and extracting the data of the channel from YouTube, we prepared the data for analysis by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check the data types of each column and number of non-null values</li>
  <li>Convert numerical columns to numeric</li>
  <li>Remove the column ‘favouriteCount’ since this column has no data</li>
  <li>Convert ‘duration’ column to seconds</li>
  <li>Add a column that indicates the day of the week the videos and comments were published based on the column ‘publishedAt’</li>
  <li>Add column ‘tagCount’</li>
  <li>Remove emojis</li>
  <li>Insert a column to indicate the language the comment was written in and remove comments in languages other than English</li>
  <li>Remove stop words and special characters, lemmatize words</li>
  <li>Get the number of words in each comment</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="eda">EDA</h2>
<p>The exploratory data analysis was done with target questions in mind. Some of the insights learned are shown below.</p>

<h4 id="correlation">Correlation</h4>
<p>There is a direct correlation between price and year. The more higher (more recent) the year, the higher the price of the used car since it is relatively newer. On the other hand, there is an indirect correlation between price and odometer. The higher the odometer reading, the lower the price of the car. This because the odometer reading reflects how much the car has been used. This translates to the amount of wear and tear the car has endured. The more the car has been used, the lower the price.</p>
