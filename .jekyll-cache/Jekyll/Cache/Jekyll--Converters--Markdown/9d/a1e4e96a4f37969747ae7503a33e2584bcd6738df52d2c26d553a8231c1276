<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiolZNLiJplmCCzqk9-czQ">Be Kind Rewind</a></strong> is a YouTube channel mainly about past best actress winners, women in film, and film and Hollywood history. The videos delve into the career of these accomplished women and the circumstances that lead to their win. The videos are well-researched and very insightful. I love history, I love film, and I love women in film so I truly enjoy every video from this channel. And so I wanted to see what other people thought about this channel and its videos.<br />
In this project, I apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine the general sentiments on this channel. The results of this project will provide the creator behind this YouTube channel a good idea of how viewers perceive the content produced.</p>
