<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data">Kaggle.com</a>. The used cars dataset was first scraped in 2018 from Craigslist. It is updated every few months with the latest data. The dataset was split into pre-pandemic and pandemic datasets. There are 23 variables in the dataset before any preprocessing and cleaning. It has 1,961,218 samples with 1,076,152 pre-pandemic data and 885,066 data during the pandemic.</p>

<h2 id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Steps taken to clean the data included remove unnecessary columns, remove samples wiht missing values, and remove outliers among others. The final dataset after preprocessing and cleaning contained 194,861 rows. All the variables were categorical except for price and mileage (odometer) which were converted to price range and mileage range, respectively. The 14 independent variables were one-hot encoded into 884 independent variables.</p>

<h2 id="eda">EDA</h2>
<p>The exploratory data analysis was done with target questions in mind. Some of the insights learned are shown below.</p>

<h4 id="correlation">Correlation</h4>
<p>There is a direct correlation between price and year. The more higher (more recent) the year, the higher the price of the used car since it is relatively newer. On the other hand, there is an indirect correlation between price and odometer. The higher the odometer reading, the lower the price of the car. This because the odometer reading reflects how much the car has been used. This translates to the amount of wear and tear the car has endured. The more the car has been used, the lower the price.</p>
